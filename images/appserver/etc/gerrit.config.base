# The "web_sessions" cache tracks open user sessions.  These effectively map a

# this cache determines how often a user must sign in again.

# Note that the Gerrit documentation suggests that a value of 0 will allow
# entries to remain in the cache until it fills.  This appears to not to be the
# case in practice.  Instead, we have selected a large positive value.
