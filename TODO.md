* Test crbackup/crrestore to deploy a new production deployment with latest
  changes
* Document crbackup and crrestore
* Try 2.11 (or 2.13?) to fix two bugs:
  - firefox: copying text from browser
  - firefox: the login bug people are hitting
* Add nginx image to this repository
* Backup and restore scripts need cleaning up
* Would be nice to have a plugin to auto-update commit message with reviewers
  and approved-by (without the other metadata that Gerrit likes to add)
* backup story for github repos?
* are the "project owner" settings what we want?
* auto-import people's public keys and email addresses from GitHub?
* set up commit message validation
* set up jenkins integration for 'make check'
* set up jenkins integration for 'make test'
* any kind of monitoring?
* move to docker compose or some other way to keep track of the whole app?
